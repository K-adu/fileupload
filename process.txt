et up the project:

Initialize a new Node.js project.
Install necessary dependencies, such as Express, Handlebars, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, and any other required packages.
Create the file structure:

Create the necessary directories and files for the project, including routes, controllers, views, and models.
Set up the database:

Choose and set up a database system (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to store user information.
Create a user schema/model with fields like name, email, password, etc.
Implement the signup functionality:

Create a route and controller to handle the signup process.
In the signup route, validate the incoming request data (e.g., check for required fields, email format).
Hash the user's password using a hashing algorithm (e.g., bcryptjs).
Create a new user object based on the validated data and save it to the database.
Generate a JWT (JSON Web Token) with a secret key and include relevant user information.
Return the JWT as a response to the client.
Implement the login functionality:

Create a route and controller to handle the login process.
In the login route, validate the incoming request data (e.g., check for required fields).
Retrieve the user from the database based on the provided email.
Compare the provided password with the stored hashed password using bcryptjs.
If the passwords match, generate a new JWT with the user information.
Return the JWT as a response to the client.
Protect routes with JWT authentication:

Create middleware to verify and decode the JWT in incoming requests.
Apply the middleware to the routes that require authentication.
Extract the user information from the JWT and make it available in the request object.
Create the views:

Design and create the necessary views using Handlebars to display signup and login forms.
Include appropriate form validation and error handling.
Integrate views with routes:

Render the appropriate views in the signup and login routes.
Handle form submissions and send the data to the server.
Handle authentication status:

Implement logic to display different content or navigation based on the user's authentication status.
Store the JWT securely on the client-side (e.g., local storage, cookies) and send it with subsequent requests.
Test the application:

Test the signup and login functionalities with different scenarios (e.g., valid credentials, invalid credentials, edge cases).
Ensure that the authentication and authorization mechanisms work as expected.
Remember, this is an algorithmic representation of the steps involved. You will need to refer to the documentation of specific packages and frameworks for detailed implementation guidelines.
